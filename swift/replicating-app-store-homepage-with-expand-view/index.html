</div><h1><strong>Replicate App Store Homepage With Expand View</strong></h1><p><strong><em>Currently work with Xcode 11.4, Swift 5</em></strong></p><p>As iOS developers, we are all familiar with Apple's fancy expanding view in their app store. Everything from the animation to the gesture trigger to the scroll view is super clean. So today, we are trying to replicate the Apple App store homepage with SwiftUI. It won't be 100% perfect, but the result is pretty close and work with dynamic data.</p><h3><strong>Preparing Data</strong></h3><pre data-language="swift"><code><span class="hljs-comment">// Item for data</span>

</code></pre><ol><li>1.<code>//1</code> will be used to get the drag gesture value and set our scale animation.</li><li>2.<code>//2</code>, We only want to activate gesture when the view is expanded. Also unless the translation value is above 200, the drag gesture won't do anything <code>onChanged</code>. I also place a restriction <code>//3</code> that close the expanded view after it passes a value of 400. <code>onEnded</code> is optional but what if I only drag in the range of 200-400, I want anything above 300 to be close the expand view when I release my finger.</li><li>3.<code>//4</code>, the <code>dragValue</code> will usually be in the hundreds so I want to divide it by 1000 to make it within the range of 0-1, which in our case will never be 1000 because be set our limit of 400 above.</li></ol><h3><strong>ScrollView In Main Page</strong></h3><p>The final stretch is to list all our item in the <code>ContentView</code></p><pre data-language="swift"><code><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">struct</span> <span class="hljs-title">ContentView</span>: <span class="hljs-title">View</span> </span>{

</code></pre><ol><li>1.<code>//1</code> and <code>//2</code>, we use <code>GeometryReader</code> for the sake of getting a minY value so we can push the view to the top of the screen with <code>offset</code>.</li><li>2.<code>//3</code> saying that if there is actively expand view and you aren't the view that is expanded, hide yourself so when scale effect happens you won't show up.</li><li>3.Without <code>//4</code>, all the items will collapse and stack on each other.</li></ol><h3><strong>Showing It Work With Dynamic Data</strong></h3><p>In the <code>Image("avatar")</code>, add a tap gesture to append another <code>Item</code> to the <code>items</code> array, you will see the content being add at the end when you scroll down. This is where you use <code>img5</code> just to see that something got added.</p><h3><strong>Result of Our Awesome Animation</strong></h3><p>I think it's close enough to the Apple homepage. There is still a small scale effect when you scroll pass bottom or accidentally activate scale effect at top of <code>ScrollView</code>. I've tried scale effect with a trackable scroll view that uses <code>CGFloat</code>, but it didn't work as best as this method. Trackable scroll view preference key doesn't update as often as we want so scale effect act weirdly.</p><video width="250" height="500" controls>
